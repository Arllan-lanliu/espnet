# Initial result: single channel, no front end, 8ch simulation data + WSJ SI284 training
# According to the challenge results (https://reverb2014.dereverberation.com/result_asr.html)
# The simulation data results below seem to be very good while the real data results are significantly
# worse than those reported including the official HTK baseline.
# The end-to-end system tends to be over-tuned only with the training conditions.
#
# Results after adding WPE & BeamformIt: single channel, 2 channel and 8 channel, 8ch simulation data (no enhanced data in training) + WSJ SI284 training 
# Comparing to the challenge results (https://reverb2014.dereverberation.com/result_asr.html), 
# 8ch with WPE+BeamformIt during evaluation for both real and simulation is better than some submissions and comparable to other submissions
# Performance of Delcroix et al. is better than our result but they seem to be using their own dataset for acoustic model.
